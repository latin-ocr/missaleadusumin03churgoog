MS. T.

This is another of Tothergill's books, in York Minster Library.

It is, unfortunately, very imperfect3 the whole of the (1011011 10
missing. But it has been found ver)⁷ useful, 00 11 contains the Sequences
at length.

This MS. did 1101 come into my hands until this volume was printed
as 101· as the First Sundayafter Easter. › From that place the notieeable
variations of the MS. are noted. Of those previous to that Snnday the
following may he added :—

In pp. 8, 46, and 101, this MS. agrees with B and Ο, as noted.

At p. 121 it gives the Plain Ohant 101 the Preface. This will he
printed in the edition of the Manual.

111 the Sequence, p. 127, 11110 4, “paradisi nudulum” appears 10 be
corrected 10 “vidulum ;'' perhaps “ viduum '' may be the 11110 reading.

The 10110 containing the Mass 101 S. Thomas (Dec. 29), in respect 01 ’
which there is so much variatim, is missing.

singularly rich in Liturgical MSS. and printed books, principally 01 the

ornament 10 the Fitzwilliam Missal. One or two 1eaves only 010 missing.

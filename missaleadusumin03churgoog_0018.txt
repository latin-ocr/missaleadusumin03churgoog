There can be no doubt that Violette's is the first edition of the York
Missal, and that, as Mons. Frena* suggests, judging from the period

duriii] ψὶίἰέῑὲι9νίοἰθὺὴο was engaged in printing, its date is, as nearly os
possi e, .

lt differs from the later editions only-

1. In omitting the notices as to the different months in the Calendar,
which will be found in pp. xlii-xlm

2. In placing the “Modus finiendi Collectas’' after the first rubrio in
the sanctorale, instead of at the close.

3. The “Considerationes circa Missam celebrandam,” with which the
other Edd. commoneo, follow the “Sanctorale.''

The five editions seem to have been made successively, the one from
the other, and probably only represent a single MS. or, at the outside,
two. The errors of the first edition are, with the exception of the cor-
rectiones a few misprints, perpetuated throughout; as, for instance, in
the omission of a line of the MS. in the first rubrio in “Sabbato Sancto
Pasohee‚'' and in pntting the Mass for S. Petrocins in April instead of

June. The editions differ from one another considerably in the length
of thenotes in the music.

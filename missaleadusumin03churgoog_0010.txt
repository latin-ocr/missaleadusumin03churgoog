PREFAOE.

ans Edicion of the York Missal has been made from a colla

tion of the manuscript Missals known to exist, and from lhe
five printed editions. ·

I have to express my sense of 'ohe invariable courdesy I
have mel wilh from che owners of these Manuscripls, who have
most liberally placed 'ehem ab my disposal for ohe purposes of
» this edition: especially io she Dean and Chapter of York3 che
Rev. John Gon, Vicar of Leeds; the Masier and Fellows of
University Oollege, Oxford ; the Masler and Fellows of Sidney
Sussex College, Cambridge3 'ohe Rector and Officers of the College
of Stenyhursl3 ohe Curators of ohe Bodleian; and Mr. Kerslake,
of Brisiol.

With regard ’ao 'ohe collalion of these originals, is should
be said, that as a rule, mere verba] variations of rubrics have
nol been noted, excepi in the case ofdhe Canon of the Mass3
but any variation of expression which rendered she meaning
at all more clear, or seemed on any other ground worth pre-
serving, has been recorded.

The gr’eatesb amount of additional rubric is given in MS. D„
now in the library of Sidney Sussex Collega Cambridge, which
is described below3 the additions and varialions supplied by
this Manusoript are of a most interesting' character, and give
very fully 'ohe Use in the Oathedral Ohurch ab the date when the
Missal was wrii’een. ’

The variations as io Oeremonial of ohe Canon of ohe Mass are
fully given in parallel columns. Of the seven manuscripb Missals
